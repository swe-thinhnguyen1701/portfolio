        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I’m Thinh Nguyen (Charles), an enthusiastic and motivated
          software engineer. I graduated from San Jose State University with a
          degree in Applied Mathematics, and I am eager to kickstart my career
          in full stack development.<br /><br>
          During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in computer
          science, including algorithms, advance calculus, linear algebra,
          discrete math, computer architecture, advanced java programming
          language, data structure, and time/space complexity. Additionally, I
          am currently enrolled in the UC Berkeley Full Stack Boot Camp, where I
          am honing my skills in web development, database management, and
          modern software engineering practices. I have also completed various
          academic projects that gave me hands-on experience and helped me
          sharpen my problem-solving abilities.<br /><br>
          I’m passionate about software engineer, and I am excited to continue
          learning and growing in this dynamic field. I’m eager to contribute my
          skills and knowledge to collaborative team environment where I can
          make a meaningful impact.<br /><br>
          I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge
          as a software engineer or full stack developer, where I can contribute
          to innovative projects and collaborate with talented teams. I’m open
          to roles that allow me to continue growing and expanding my skill set,
          whether it’s in a startup environment where I can wear multiple hats
          or in a larger organization with established processes. I’m ready to
          bring my enthusiasm, dedication, and willingness to learn to a
          supportive and growth-oriented organization that values creativity,
          collaboration, and continuous improvement.
